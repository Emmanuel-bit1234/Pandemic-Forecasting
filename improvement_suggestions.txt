Improvement Suggestions:
To enhance the accuracy of the COVID-19 case forecast, it would be beneficial to incorporate additional data types. 
These could include variables like local COVID-19 vaccination rates, public health policy changes (e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates), 
and international travel restrictions. Socioeconomic factors, healthcare system capacity, and public compliance with health guidelines 
could also be relevant. Integrating real-time social media sentiment analysis might provide insights into public behavior and compliance trends.
